						<h2>Pardon Our Progress</h2>
						<p class="sub-title">Exciting Changes are in the Works</p>
						<p class="body-text">
							We are expanding our GIS Server Site and upgrading the software.  As a result, the website address (URL) has changed from <a href="http://maps.brgov.com/gis/rest" style="color: white">http://maps.brgov.com/gis/rest</a>.	The new URL is <a href="https://maps.brla.gov/gis/rest" style="color: white">https://maps.brla.gov/gis/rest</a>.	Please make any necessary changes to your GIS workspaces and/or applications, as the old website will be deactivated on December 31, 2016.

					<p>
						In October 1993, the City of Baton Rouge and Parish of East Baton Rouge initiated a Geographic Information System (GIS) Program.  This initiative fulfilled an objective of the first City-Parish comprehensive plan known as the Horizon Plan.
					</p>
					<p>
						The eBRGIS Program website provides information about Enterprise GIS, geospatial data, street addressing, and more. Be sure to visit the <a href="http://ebrgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/" title="Map Portal"><strong>Map Portal</strong></a> to access a wide variety of web maps and applications.  Also, to assist with research needs, please browse the Lookup Tools menu which includes several applications that can query information directly from the GIS data repository.
					</p>
				<br>

				<strong>Vision</strong>
				<p>
					The vision of the eBRGIS Program is to enhance government operations and services through the implementation of a common location platform by extending geospatial capabilities throughout the City-Parish.	In the fall of 2014, Mayor-President Holdenâ€™s Administration requested the Department of Information Services to focus on the following three strategies:
					<ul>
						<li>Improve and enhance workflows across all City-Parish departments</li>
						<li>Use location technologies to improve emergency preparedness and response</li>
						<li>Provide open access to data for transparency and innovation opportunities</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<strong>Implementation</strong>
				<p>
					To realize a true Enterprise GIS solution in East Baton Rouge Parish it requires leadership and coordination between the numerous stakeholders within City-Parish Government and other agencies.  Project coordination is an ongoing challenge to ensure there are no duplications of effort, and that the work products meet certain standards.	The <a href="http://gis.brla.gov/gisteam.asp" title="Enterprise GIS Team">Enterprise GIS Team</a> which is comprised of representatives from stakeholder departments works together to implement the eBRGIS Program strategies and objectives.
				</p>
